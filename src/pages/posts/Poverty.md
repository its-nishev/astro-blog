India is home to more than 1.4 billion people and is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. With a monstrous population and limited resources, people will face poverty more acutely in the coming decade. Cultivable lands are being converted into living spaces, cities are getting more polluted due to overpopulation, and poverty is setting in more deeply as a result. Along with this, the illiteracy rate will increase since poverty affects the literacy rate in any country. They are hard for the government and citizens to tackle, especially in a country that does not have a high budget for education.
