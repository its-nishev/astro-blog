Indiaâ€™s first climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), was published in 2020. The climate change seen in the country since the middle of the 20th century is expected to continue in the future. For example, the average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901-2018, according to the assessment. By the end of the 21st century, this is expected to rise by around 4.4 degrees Celsius compared to the recent past. The frequency of summer heat waves is also projected to increase 3-4 times. 

While monsoon precipitation has declined, there are more frequent dry spells and more intense wet spells. According to a paper published by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, stating rainfall of higher intensity will increase all over India, the degree of increase will be more in the south Indian region compared to the north and central India by the end of the century.
